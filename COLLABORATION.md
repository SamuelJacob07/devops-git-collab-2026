# DevOps Batch – Git Collaboration Project 2026

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository is a collaborative project created by the **DevOps Batch 2026** to practice **real-world Git collaboration**.

The goal of this project is to simulate how multiple engineers work on a shared codebase **without breaking each other’s work**, following DevOps best practices.

---

## 🎯 Project Idea

* A **shared Home Page** (`index.html`) lists all participants.
* Each participant creates **their own HTML page** inside the `participants/` folder.
* The home page links to each participant’s page.
* Every contributor owns **only their own file**, avoiding conflicts.

This structure ensures:

* Safe collaboration
* Clean Git history
* Zero overwriting of others’ work

## 👥 Contribution Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

1. **Do NOT delete or modify existing content**
2. **Do NOT edit other participants’ files**
3. Add **only ONE block** for yourself in `index.html`
4. Create **only your own HTML file** inside `participants/`
5. Use **clear commit messages**
6. Always `git pull` before pushing
