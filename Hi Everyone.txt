Hi everyone 👋

I’ve set up a **Git Collaboration Project** for our DevOps batch.

🧠 **Idea:**
We’ll have one shared home page and individual pages for each participant, so everyone can contribute safely without overwriting others’ work.

📌 **How to contribute (IMPORTANT):**

1. Clone the repo
2. Create **your own HTML file** inside the `participants/` folder
   (example: `participants/yourname.html`)
3. Add **ONE card/link** with your name in `index.html`
4. Do **NOT** edit or delete other content
5. Commit with a clear message
   (example: `Added my DevOps profile page`)
6. Push after pulling latest changes

🎯 This helps us practice:

* Git collaboration
* Conflict avoidance
* Real DevOps team workflow

## ▶️ How to Run and View the Project

This project is a static website and must be accessed through an HTTP server for proper navigation.

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Git installed
* Python 3 installed (available by default on most Linux/macOS systems)

---

### 🚀 Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd devops-git-collab-2026
```

2. **Start a local web server**

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3. **Open the website in a browser**

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

### ✅ What to Verify

* The **Home page (`index.html`)** loads correctly
* Clicking on a participant card opens the individual page
* Clicking **“Back to Home”** returns to the main page

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> Do not open `index.html` directly using the file explorer (`file://`).
> Always use the local server to ensure correct navigation.

### 🌐 (Optional) Hosting

For personal testing or demos, contributors may fork the repository and enable GitHub Pages on their own fork.
Do not enable hosting on the shared repository.
